	 * -- first rotate 90 degrees, then -90 degrees -- no rotation

	 * block that was originally south of the player will now be west of the player
	 * a block that was originally in front of the player will still be in front of
	 * the player
	 * 
	 * player facing west first, then east first -- rotate from west to south -- -90

	 * rotated 180 degrees around the player
